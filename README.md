## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow



### Continued development

I've built projects using JS before but I haven't really tackled adding more JS to my websites. I would like to use more JS in the future and further improve on the mobile dropdown menu. I would also like to try a project like this using CSS grid instead of flexbox.


### Useful resources

- [dev.to](https://dev.to/ljcdev/easy-hamburger-menu-with-js-2do0)
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_mobile_navbar.asp)
- I used both of the above resources to help me with getting the mobile menu to work. I originally had a different hamburger menu but I didn't like how it looked after clicking on it to view the other links.
